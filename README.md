A sample monorepo with supabase and turborepo 

Unfortunately, the business model at my current company does not allow us to open source our code. To still be able to share my learninsg, I will update this repository with sample configurations and code. Further, it will contain examples for all my current and upcoming open source projects.

## Features and Roadmap
- [x] Turborepo and Supabase [see blog post](https://philipp.steinroetter.com/posts/supabase-turborepo)
- [ ] Shared components library with TailwindCSS and Storybook
- [ ] NextJS app using supabase-cache-helpers
- [ ] ... samples for upcoming os projects. [Follow](https://twitter.com/psteinroe) to receive updates!
